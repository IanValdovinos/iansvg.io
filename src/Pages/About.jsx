        <ParagraphOne>
          Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a software engineer with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer
          Science from Michigan State University, class of 2024. Currently, I
          work at General Motors as a Vehicle Performance Engineer, where I
          apply my passion for creating innovative software solutions. As a full
          stack engineer, Iâ€™ve built most of my experience through academic
          projects and personal work, and Iâ€™m excited to begin my career in AI
          and machine learning. Looking ahead, Iâ€™m passionate about developing
          software toolsâ€”whether mobile apps, web applications, or AI-powered
          solutionsâ€”that directly benefit the clients of the company I work for
          or enhance the efficiency of internal teams. When Iâ€™m not coding,
          youâ€™ll find me playing video games or diving into Magic: The Gathering
          TCG.
